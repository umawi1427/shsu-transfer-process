                <li>Engage in at least <strong>10 hours of community service</strong> per semester (optional but highly encouraged).</li>
                <li><strong>Advance Registration:</strong> Completing the 10 hours of service each semester qualifies you for early registration.

For example, a Fall 2021 incoming student can register early for Spring 2022, even without prior service. However, you must complete and submit a <strong>Community Service Form</strong> during your first semester to maintain eligibility for future semesters.</li>
                <li>Attend at least <strong>3 Honors events</strong> per academic year.</li>
            </ul>
